* Apply limits per-device
* Works well in environment with multiple devices and multiple testers
* Works well as virtual machine bridged with separate wireless network

## Requirements

* OpenWrt device running on [**Barrier Breaker**](http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/) - can be router or virtual machine
* Two network interfaces - one for WAN and one for WIFI/LAN

## Installation

The are a few simple steps to install Cellular Data Network Simulator:

1. Install cdns:

        opkg update
        opkg install http://polidea.github.io/Cellular-Data-Network-Simulator/cdns_0.5-3_all.ipk
        
    Installation of Cellular Data Network Simulator replaces default Luci webpage. The Luci can be accessed using: http://ip-address/index-old.html

2. Configure:

        vim /etc/config/cdns

    By default there are 5 profiles: Full, HSDPA, Edge, GPRS and Disabled.
    
    In order to support packet capture uploads to Cloudshark, you must edit the cloudshark_api_token parameter. You must create an account at https://www.cloudshark.org and retrieve your API token from the Preferences / API Tokens drop-down menu.

3. Start the service:

        /etc/init.d/cdns enable
        /etc/init.d/cdns start
        
    That simply enables and starts the service,
        
4. Start the uhttpd daemon:

        /etc/init.d/uhttpd enable
        /etc/init.d/uhttpd start

    If you didnâ€™t do it before you have to enable and start the uhttpd daemon.
    
5. Start using:

    Simply open: http://ip-address/.

## Uninstallation

        /etc/init.d/cdns stop
        opkg remove cdns
